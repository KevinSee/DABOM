\title{Modify basic JAGS model - LGR}
\usage{
fixNoFishNodes_LGR(
  init_file = NULL,
  file_name = NULL,
  filter_ch = NULL,
  parent_child = NULL,
  configuration = NULL,
  fish_origin = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{init_file}{name (with file path) of basic JAGS model.}

\item{file_name}{name (with file path) to save the model as.}

\item{filter_ch}{filtered capture history as returned by the `filterDetections()`
function in the `PITcleanr` package, which has then been verified by a user and all
blank or NA `user_keep_obs` entries have been completed.}

\item{parent_child}{data frame with at least `parent` and `child` columns.
Can be created with `buildParentChild()` function in the `PITcleanr` package.}

\item{configuration}{is a data frame which assigns node names to unique SiteID, AntennaID, and
site configuration ID combinations. One example can be built with the function `buildConfig`}

\item{fish_origin}{tibble containing `tag_code` and origin ("W" or "H")
of every tag. If not supplied, every tag will be assigned "W".}
}
\description{
Takes the basic JAGS model and modifies it based on particular observations. Specifically, it fixes the detection probability of all nodes that had no observations to 0.
