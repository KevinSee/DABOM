\title{Write DABOM JAGS model - LGR}
\usage{
writeDABOM_LGR(
  file_name = NULL,
  parent_child = NULL,
  configuration = NULL,
  time_varying = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_name}{name (with file path) to save the model as}

\item{parent_child}{data frame with at least `parent` and `child` columns.
Can be created with `buildParentChild()` function in the `PITcleanr` package.}

\item{configuration}{is a data frame which assigns node names to unique SiteID, AntennaID, and
site configuration ID combinations. One example can be built with the function `buildConfig`}

\item{time_varying}{Should the initial movement probabilities be time-varying? Default value is `FALSE`}
}
\description{
This writes the overall JAGS model for a generic DABOM as a text file. It can then be modified depending on the observations for a particular valid tag list.
