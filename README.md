# DABOM
Dam Adult Branch Occupancy Model

`SCOBI` is an R package for performing compositional analyses of adults and smolts at Lower Granite Dam. Adults are analyzed using 
the function `SCOBI()`. Juveniles are analyzed using the function `SCRAPI()`. It also contains the useful functions `lgr2SCOBI()` 
and `lgr2SCRAPI()` for formatting raw data from the Lower Granite Dam trapping database (LGTrappingDB) for input into the `SCOBI()`
and `SCRAPI()` functions.

## Getting Started

To install `SCOBI` you can use Hadley Wickham's `devtools` package. To install and load the `devtools` package use:
```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```
NOTE: To use `devtools`, you may also have to download and install Rtools (although you shouldn't). The latest version on Rtools can be found at
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/

Once `devtools` is successfully installed, use the following to install SCOBI:
```
devtools::install_github("mackerman44/SCOBI")
```
Alternatively, Bryce Oldemeyer has a GitHub account and maintains an up-to-date fork of the SCOBI repository. Therefore, SCOBI can
also be downloaded using:
```
devtools::install_github("Boldemeyer/SCOBI")
```
If you are interested in making contributions to SCOBI, consider getting a GitHub account, fork this repository, clone to a local directory, modify, and send me a pull request. I can then review any changes and merge.
